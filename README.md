# ElectronAttachment
Code to use electron attachment data for O<sub>2</sub> in liquid xenon to convert between O<sub>2</sub> concentration and electron lifetime.

## Usage

Run `ElectronAttachment.py` with arguments `-Efield` and `-conc` to specify the electric field in Volts/cm and equivalent O<sub>2</sub> concentration in ppb respectively. The script will print the equivalent electron lifetime in &mu;s. `ElectronAttachment.py` can also be imported so that the functions for some basic thermodynamic calculations can be used.
